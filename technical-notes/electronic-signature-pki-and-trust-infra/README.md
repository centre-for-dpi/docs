Three key components make up this DPI category:

1. **Digital Signatures or PKI**: To ensure a document, certificate, or data packet hasn't been tampered with, a nation needs to generate the capability to affix a verifiable digital signature.
2. **eSignatures**: The ability of an individual or entity to electronically sign a document digitally (via mobile) to indicate agreement
3. **Granular Consent**: The ability of an individual to indicate their consent to share data for a specific purpose and time period with an indicated third party, and generate an auditable and digitally signed consent artefact to indicate that intent.&#x20;
