# 🛒 Discovery & Fulfilment

A DPI approach to Discovery and Fulfilment represents the capability to access any service or purchase any good across multiple apps in an interoperable manner. This can include:

1. **Open APIs for government services** such as tax filing or business registration
2. **A shared protocol for purchase of goods or services** across sectors (such as [BeckN](https://beckn.io/)) including for use cases such as:
   1. Open Mobility/Transport: using any one app or interface, book railways, flights, buses, or cabs interoperably.
   2. Open eCommerce: Buyers and sellers can search any app to view a catalog and place an order for an item, and aren't restricted to just one two-sided marketplace app
   3. Open Financial Services: Allows borrowers to view and apply for loans or insurance products from multiple banks or insurers in any app on the network.
